# Notation Systems

## Big O Notation

This is covered primarily in asymptotic analysis.

* Big O: $\theta(n)$
* Delta (difference between measurements): $\Delta(n)$

## Logic

* Negate: invert a truth $\neg$
* Not Equal: $\neq$
* Less than or equal to: $x \leq y$
* Greater than or equal to: $x \geq y$


## Set theory notation

* Exists: There exists at least one $\exists$
* Exists: There exists one and only one $\exists!$
* Does not exist: There is no $\nexists$
* For all: $\forall$
* Implies: $x \implies y$
* Union: In A or B. $\cup$
* Intersection: In A and B. $\cap$
* Subset: Every A is in B. $A \subset B$
* Not Subset: Every A not in B $A \not\subset B$
* In: a in b $A \in B$
* Not In: a not in b $A \not\in B$
* And: $x \land y$
* Therefore: 22 divided by 2 is in the set of integers therefore 22 is even.  $22 / 2 \in \Z \therefore 22 is even$

Natural Sets

* Universal: Set of all possible values.  $\universal$
* Natural Numbers: $\N$
* Integers: $\Z$


## Set Builder Notation

## Summation Notation

$\{\,x \mid x \text{ is positive and even}\,\}$
